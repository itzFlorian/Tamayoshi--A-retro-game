# "tamaYOSHI"
A BRANDNEW RETRO GAME by BreffJaun, itzFlorian and grossesbewirken.
Dedicated to Jeffs Cat called Yoshi and the old Tamagotchi-Game.
Just pure JavaScript, a clear Terminal and joy of games from 1997.
But more Yoshi than Tamagotchi as you might think off.

## How to start?
1. Start the game on your terminal => "npx tamayoshi"
2. Enjoy the life of a 24/7 cat servant!

## How to play?
"tamaYOSHI" is the javascript version of owning a cat, what basically means, to be the servant of a cat.
And Yoshis is the "Highness" of all cats. So be prepared for "Your Highnesses high standards".  

That´s why tamaYOSHI has THREE game modes: 
   + **FOOTMAN** (easy): for beginners, means, people who haven´t hat a cat before  
   + **VALET** (normal): for those, who think they know cats.  
   + **BUTLER** (hard): for those, who never met Yoshi before.  

## How it works?
Yoshi will tell you, what to do. If you don´t full fill all his needs, you´ll get fired. That easy!
+ #### FOOD: 
   Finest Tuna > Cat Food > Lasagne
+ #### DRINK: 
   Just Pure Water > Cool Fresh Milk > Nice Champagne
+ #### MOOD:
   Turn on the TV! > Dance for me! > Stroke my Belly!

## How we made it?
We are all DCI students since March 2022. We will become web developer and started JavaScript 2 month ago.
This is our final modul project. That´s why you just have a terminal instead of fancy stuff. For fancy stuff visit our younger repos.
